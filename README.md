# Intro to Programming – Python Exercises

This repository contains all of the Python files I've created while learning foundational programming concepts. The files represent exercises, practice problems, and small projects I've worked on as part of my introductory programming coursework.

These programs are written in Python and cover topics such as:
- Basic input and output
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Simple file handling
- Problem-solving logic

My goal is to document my learning progress, improve my coding style, and build a portfolio of small Python scripts that reflect what I've learned so far.
