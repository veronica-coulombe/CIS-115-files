## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project running on your local machine for learning and practice.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.x) installed  
- A code editor or IDE (e.g. VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)  
- Optionally, knowledge of how to run Python scripts from the terminal or command line

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veronica-coulombe/CIS-115-files.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd CIS-115-files
   ```

## Usage

Here are some ways you might run the files in this repo:

```bash
# Run a specific program, e.g.:
python3 programOne.py

# Or:
python shoppingAtWholeFoods.py
```

Feel free to open the files in your editor to explore the logic. These are learning exercises.

| File | Purpose / What it Teaches |
|---|---|
| `programOne.py` | An early program, dealing with basic input/output or simple logic |
| `shoppingAtWholeFoods.py` | A program simulating shopping logic, working with lists or control flow |
| `pythonProgramFile.py` | Another practice file for logic / functions / flow control |
